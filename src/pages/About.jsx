        About My Library Project
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Hi there! I'm Pooja, and this library catalog is my project. As someone
        who's always lost in books, I wanted to create something that captures
        my love for reading while practicing my web development skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I built this catalog to organize my favorite books and hopefully help
        fellow readers discover stories that have moved me. From dog-eared
        novels that kept me up all night to non-fiction that changed how I see
        the world, each entry here has a special place in my journey.
      </p>
